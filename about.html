## About

My name is Alejandro López Sánchez. I was born in A Coruña, Spain.

I love JavaScript, I want to learn everything posible about it, so I'm currently working as a Frontend developer.
In the future I pretend to be a JS Ninja. I will work whatever is needed to achieve this goal.

You can check my projects on my <a href="https://github.com/alopezsanchez" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a>.
